      <p>The seed for development was first planted when I was a CNC laser operator.</p>
      <p>With a thirst to learn from those around me as well as personal research, I learned not only how to operate a CNC laser, but how to manipulate and edit the code!</p>
      <p>Those skills have played a key role in my growth and development in this field. I am driven to learn and research new things and with a strong work ethic I aspire to achieve great things in the world of development!</p>
